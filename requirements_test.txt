# DEBUG/DEVELOPMENT configuration: use this to update your venv to experiment with modules that won't or should not be
# deployed to compute environments on cloud (e.g AWS Lambda, Glue, EMR). Main category of modules that fall
#
# Auxiliary dependencies that are intended to be used for local debugging and testing.
#
# This list is the bare minimum for a testing/debugging environment. You can add more such as PySpark, etc based on your
# local development requirements. You are advised to restore your venv with 'requirements.txt' before any activations
# against cloud. This is the case till a much smarter deployment (activation) time venv / dependency management is
# supported in the framework.
