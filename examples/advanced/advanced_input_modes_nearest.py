# This example covers advanced input mode 'nearest' (or 'latest').
#
# 'nearest' flag on an input signal tells RheocerOS to scan its range and keeps it blocked until a resource
# is available. Then during the execution, RheocerOS is expected to use the resource (e.g partition) closest to
# the execution dimensions (the 'tip' of the trigger group, e.g execution date).

#  - can get/assume its dev-role (won't help if this is the first run)
